# uhh my first discord bot hi
basically it has ?help uhh u can find everything there, the code is spaghetti and it sucks!!
its just me tryna learn smth new ok dont be mad at me if its impossible to read it ok?


oh yeah also dont forget to put ur bot token in .env that should be obvious
and also go to bot.js and change the channel ids so the bot wouldn't return.
ok im so sleepy i dont even have energy to make the readme any better
